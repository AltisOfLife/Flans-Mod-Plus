# Flan's Mod Ultimate Stability Edition

Unofficial 1.7.10 continuation of Flan's Mod Ultimate.

Please don't redistribute any code without permission.

This version of Flan's Mod Plus aims to be the most recent and stable.

## Project Status

FMUSE has been actively maintained by [@GoldSloth](https://github.com/GoldSloth)
and myself for the last 3+ years. While I genuinely appreciate all the support
we've received, either as feedback or pull requests, as time has gone on, both
GoldSloth and I have lost interest in Minecraft modding. We will continue providing bug
fixes and support for the foreseeable future, and we're still accepting
pull requests, but expect fewer releases and new features.
